WEB FRAMEWORK
---------------------------------------------------------
‘web application frameworks’ or ‘web frameworks’ as “a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources and web APIs”. In simple words, web frameworks are a piece of software that offers a way to create and run web applications. Thus, you don’t need to code on your own and look for probable miscalculations and faults.

Many find it difficult to differ the web app framework from CMS (Content Management System). When you are building a website or a web app the first thing you need is tools. You can create from scratch but not everyone is proficient in programming languages. CMS, in this case, relieves the stress of the need to have such expertise, meanwhile frameworks offer a set of features that you can use to create a custom application.

The front-end frameworks mostly manage the external part of the website, i.e. what the user sees when they open the application. The back-end manages the internal part. Let’s take a deeper look

1. Server-side Frameworks
The rules and architecture of the server-side frameworks permit you to create simple pages, landings and forms of different kinds. To create a web application with a well-developed interface you need a wider range of functionality. Server-side frameworks handle HTTP requests, database control and management, URL mapping, etc. These frameworks can improve security and form the output data- simplifying the development process. Some of the top server-side frameworks are –

NET (C#)
Django (Python)
Ruby on Rails (Ruby)
Express (JavaScript/Node.JS)
Symfony (PHP)
2. Client-side Frameworks
Client-side frameworks don’t take care of the business logic like the server-side ones. They function inside the browser. Therefore, you can enhance and implement new user interfaces. A number of animated features can be created with frontend and single page applications. Every client-side framework varies in functionality and use. Here are some client-side frameworks for comparison’s sake; all of whom use JavaScript as their programming language-

Angular
Ember.JS
Vue.JS
React.JS
